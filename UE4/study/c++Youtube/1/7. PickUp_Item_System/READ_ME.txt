First of all, make function at .h file... (Character) 

protected:
	void BeginPickUp();

	void EndPickUp();

	void ShowInventory();

Than set 
	bool bIsPickingUp = false;

	TArray<FString> Inventory;   

at public


and Do it same as we did in last thing... (at .cpp)

make function...and bla bla




than go to item.h

define the component and functions
